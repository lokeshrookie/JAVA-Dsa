linkedlist implementation:

imp: During iteration, always use temporary node to point to the head
     Because, using head directly in while loop will completely vanish the linked list.

insert at any index:
1. using for loop iterate to the element that is before to the given index.
2. Here, we have to store the node(at given index) in next(temporary variable) to assign node.next.
     of new node. otherwise, after adding the new node, this new node will be end of linked list. because without next
    pointer, we can not assign the next variable in the new node.
