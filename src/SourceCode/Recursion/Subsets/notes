SUBSETS:     The process of taking some elements and removing some
               elements is knonw as this subset pattern.

1. sued in permutations and combinations.
2. subset is a non-adjacent collection.

ex: 3,5,9 ==> 3, 3,5, 3,9, 3,5,9
                5, 59, 9, etc

Recursion and Iteration:
    String = "abc"
    ans ==> a, b, c, ab, bc, ac, abc . these are the subsets of String "abc".

==> unprocessed ==   "abc"
                   /       \
                a/bc       ""/bc
               /    \       /   \
            ab/c    a/c    b/c   c
            /  \     / \   / \
         abc/  ab/  ac  a bc  b

         this recursion tree tells about the all the substrings.
